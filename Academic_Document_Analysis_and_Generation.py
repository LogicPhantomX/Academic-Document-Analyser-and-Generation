"""So Here we Go.

Note:
-  It must have a proper structure following the order 
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Conclusion
4. Reference

- For the citation generation its not going to be like AI generation oooo its going to be like using inputs to get in
the data and make a compilation of it into a document on it's own and done its generated. So we are to align this
genration of a thing in the following Formats: 1. APA 2. MLA 3. Chicago 4. IEEE

- It must be able to check and compare the references of both what is written in the document being checked and
another document where all supposed/included references supposed to be included in the document So it checks and
picks out the ones absent or unused in the document

        SO FAR ARE YOU GUYS GRABBING

- It should be able to determine the writing style in the sense that it tells us in the report on whether long
sentences were included

- It should be able to test for plagiarism in terms of if there were lot or less of similarities between texts or
documents respectively

        AND FINALLY 

- It should be able to deliver a report on the screenings and test that has been done

      AND THAT'S ALL FOR IT YOU SEE ITS SO SIMPLE (sMILEs ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)
      
Now to get down to business
- so guys definitely we are going to have the need to import some libraries because each library will handle
1. Command-line Arguments
2. File handling or directory handling
3. Plagiarism similarity test check
4. Report generation
5. The Availability to terminate a program on an error


AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M MAKING IT INTO SOME KIND OF OPTION SCENERIO THAT YOU'LL PICK EITHER PLAGIARISM AND STRUCTURE
TEST OR CITATION TEST"""
